# HydraY — Elo Roadmap and Hot-Path Audit

**Date:** 2026-09-01 · **Tree:** `a6e3bf3` (dev) · **External strength:** 3132.4 ±14.9
on the Stockfish `UCI_Elo` bracket · **bench6 @ d12:** 1,953,820

This audit was written by reading every Tier-1 and Tier-2 file end to end, not by
pattern-matching. Every claim below is tagged with how it is known:

| tag | meaning |
|---|---|
| **[M]** | Measured today, numbers reproduced in this document |
| **[C]** | Read directly from the code; the mechanism is verifiable by inspection |
| **[H]** | Hypothesis. Plausible, unmeasured, could be wrong |
| **[X]** | Already tested and settled — do not redo |

Files read in full: `searcher.cpp` (1503), `sorter.cpp`, `movepicker.hpp`,
`searchruntime.hpp`, `movelist.hpp`, `corrhist.hpp`, `search_constants.hpp`,
`accumulator.hpp`, `tt.hpp` (layout/probe/store), `boardapi.inl` (doMove path),
`time_manager.{hpp,cpp}`, `move_generator.cpp` (entry points).

## 1. The one theme that matters: material and evaluation are different units

Today's `+82.3` external Elo came from a single realisation: **`PIECE_VALUES` and
SEE are handcrafted-era centipawns; the NNUE output is on a hotter scale.** Any
expression that adds one to the other is dimensionally wrong.

Measured ratio, this build, 376 piece-removal pairs at depth 8 **[M]**:

| phase (non-pawn material) | n | material→eval ratio |
|---|---|---|
| opening / middlegame (>5000) | 134 | 1.99 |
| late middlegame (3000–5000) | 50 | 2.89 |
| early endgame (1500–3000) | 69 | 2.77 |
| endgame (<1500) | 123 | 3.20 |
| **global** | 376 | **2.62** |

Against Stockfish on identical positions at equal depth: **2.256×, with 92.4% sign
agreement** — the unit differs, the judgement does not.

### Sites fixed

| site | commit | result |
|---|---|---|
| qsearch node delta gate | `85e7c2e` | part of +105.86 |
| qsearch per-move captured-value filter | `85e7c2e` | " |
| qsearch per-move SEE filter | `85e7c2e` | " |
| ProbCut SEE-vs-margin filter | `73b877d` | **unvalidated** — see §6 |
| factor 220 → 260 | `a6e3bf3` | +15.42 ±7.66, H1 accepted |

### Sites still wrong — the highest-value work left

**1.1 `REPETITION_DRAW_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD` — DONE, and it was worth nothing [M]**

> **Resolved 2026-09-03 (`5291b28`). The mechanism was real; my ranking was wrong.**
> Instrumented before committing, over 200 searches on late-game positions
> replayed with full move history:
>
> ```
> repetition scans        136,860,059
> twofold  -> score 0       9,307,319
> threefold path                    1      <-- the branch this threshold governs
> outcome changed by fix            0
> ```
>
> The threefold branch runs about once per 200M nodes. Committed as correctness,
> **no SPRT** — it would measure nothing. The lesson generalises: *a dimensional
> error in a cold branch is still worth nothing.* Rank by
> mechanism **× firing rate**, and measure the second factor first. This is the
> third time in two days that instrumentation killed a plausible idea for ~20
> minutes instead of a 3-hour SPRT (after the corrhist caps and the data-gap
> hypothesis).
>
> **The same measurement found something better — see §2.5.**

*Original analysis, kept for the record:*

```cpp
// searcher.cpp:18
constexpr int32_t REPETITION_DRAW_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD = PAWN_VALUE / 2;   // material: 50

// searcher.cpp:156 — compared against an EVAL-scale quantity
const int32_t staticEval = Evaluator::evaluate(b);
outScore = (std::abs(staticEval) <= REPETITION_DRAW_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD) ? 0 : ...
```

This decides "is the position level enough that a repetition is acceptable?" The
threshold is half a pawn of *material*; `staticEval` is *eval*. At 2.6× the test
fires at roughly 0.19 pawns instead of 0.5 — so the engine treats far more
positions as "level" and accepts repetitions in positions where it is meaningfully
better. **This is exactly the bug class that just paid +82, in a code path that
decides whole half-points.** Fix: `materialToEval(PAWN_VALUE / 2)`.
*Highest-confidence untested item in this document.*

**1.2 Aspiration windows — TESTED AND DEAD [M]. And it reclassifies the rest of §1.**

> **Resolved 2026-09-03. Rescaled by the measured 2.6x. The mechanism worked
> exactly as predicted and the engine still got weaker.**
>
> | | before | after 2.6x |
> |---|---|---|
> | first window OK | 50.2% | **76.7%** |
> | re-searches / iteration | 0.787 | **0.309** |
> | fail low / high | 868 / 850 | 322 / 341 |
> | bench6 nodes | 1,953,820 | **3,344,881 (+71%)** |
>
> SPRT: **−7.72 ±10.78, LOS 7.30%, LLR −1.04 @ 1800** (stopped on trend). A wider
> root window prunes less at *every* node, and that cost buried the 61% cut in
> re-searches.
>
> Then the deciding measurement — sweeping the factor both ways:
>
> | factor | 50% | 70% | 85% | **100%** | 130% | 160% | 200% | 260% |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | bench6 vs base | +21.7% | +10.6% | +26.3% | **0.0%** | +15.4% | +41.6% | +55.5% | +71.2% |
>
> **The current values are a local minimum in both directions.** They are not
> mis-set; the search evolved around them.
>
> ### ⚠️ The lesson, which invalidates part of this document's premise
>
> **"Never rescaled after the eval scale changed" is a hypothesis, not a defect.**
> Two different things were being conflated:
>
> 1. **Dimensional error** — an expression that *adds material to eval*
>    (`standPat + capturedValue`, `see < PROBCUT_MARGIN`). Objectively wrong at
>    any magnitude. This is what paid **+82**.
> 2. **Magnitude drift** — a constant that is dimensionally *consistent* (eval
>    compared against eval) whose nominal chess meaning shifted. Here the value
>    may be empirically fine regardless of what the comment claims it means.
>
> The aspiration window is type 2, and so are §1.3 and §1.4 below — **downgrade
> them accordingly.** The type-1 seam is now fully mined: four sites fixed, the
> fifth (§1.1) was a dead branch. *Do not go looking for more Elo in §1.*

*Original analysis, kept for the record:*

**1.2b Aspiration window magnitudes were never rescaled [C]**

```cpp
// searcher.cpp:1412
int32_t windowDelta = std::clamp<int32_t>(15 + (scoreSwing / 4), 25, 100);
// searcher.cpp:1441
windowDelta = std::min<int32_t>(WINDOW_HARD_CAP, windowDelta * 2 + 10);   // cap 1500
```

`15`, `25`, `100`, `/4`, `*2+10` and `WINDOW_HARD_CAP` are all eval-scale
magnitudes, all hardcoded, and **none appears in any `tuning/groups/*.json`**
(verified: those files contain only `LMP_SCALE_*`, `LMR_C_PERCENT`, `SE_*`,
`SEE_CAPTURE_MARGIN`, `HISTORY_PRUNE_D*`, `RFP_MARGIN_PER_DEPTH`, `NMP_EVAL_*`,
`FUTILITY_MID_STEP`, `PROBCUT_MARGIN`). They were chosen when a pawn was 100. A
pawn is now ~260, so **the aspiration window is effectively 2.6× tighter than
designed** — more fail-highs, more fail-lows, more full re-searches per iteration,
every iteration. Note `15` is already dead code: `clamp(15 + x/4, 25, 100)` can
never return 15.

**1.3 The NMP eval gate `+100` [C]** — `searcher.cpp:888`, comment says "within
~100cp of beta". Now ~38 real cp. Hardcoded; `NMP_EVAL_DIV`/`NMP_EVAL_MAX` are
tuned but this gate is not.

**1.4 `REPETITION_CONTEMPT = 80`** — commented `~0.8 pawn`, delivers ~0.31.
**Caveat [C]:** contempt is the one parameter self-play SPRT *cannot* measure —
both sides are the same engine, so draw-avoidance against an equal opponent is
structurally penalised. Validate on the SF bracket or not at all.

**1.5 Phase-dependent factor [H]** — the 1.99→3.20 spread says no scalar is right
everywhere. But two cautions: the endgame figure is inflated by the *same
saturation* that made queens read 1.42 (in sparse positions every removal is
nearer decisive), and the middle buckets (2.89 / 2.77, n=50/69) are one value
within noise. The data supports **at most a two-level split**, not a curve.
Settle with a saturation control — restrict to removals where the post-removal
eval stays inside a moderate band — before implementing anything.

---

## 2. Hot-loop structure — branches and work that can be removed

**2.1 Loop-invariant test inside the hottest loop [C]**

```cpp
// searcher.cpp:518, inside `while (movePicker.hasNext())`
if (chess::isValidSquare(ctx.excludedMove.from) && m.sameFromTo(ctx.excludedMove))
```

`ctx.excludedMove` never changes inside the loop. This evaluates a load and a
compare on **every move of every node**. Hoist to a `const bool hasExcluded` above
the loop and the inner test collapses to a predictable, almost-always-false
branch. Pure win, node-identical — exactly the "fewer branches" class you asked
about. Verify with bench6 node-identity, then measure NPS interleaved.

**2.2 The qsearch delta prune returns a fail-hard bound in a fail-soft searcher [C]**

```cpp
// searcher.cpp:1073
if (shouldDeltaPrune(standPat, materialToEval(QSEARCH_DELTA_MARGIN), alpha)) {
    return alpha;   // <-- fail-HARD
}
```

Everything else in this searcher is fail-soft, deliberately (`return standPat`
above it is commented "fail-soft: tighter bound than a flat beta"). Here we know
`standPat + margin < alpha`, so `standPat + margin` is a *strictly tighter and
still valid* upper bound than `alpha`. Returning `alpha` hands the parent a
less informative value. No TT pollution risk — this path returns before the store.

**2.3 ProbCut builds a full `MoveList` per qualifying node [C/M]**

`searcher.cpp:912` — `MoveList captures = generateTacticalMoves(b);` constructs a
660-byte object **[M]** at every interior non-PV node with `depth >= 3`, then runs
SEE over it. Now that `73b877d` made the filter more permissive, more of those
SEEs also lead to a child search. Worth instrumenting the firing rate before
touching, per the rule that saved two SPRTs on thread voting.

**2.5 `countRepetitions` — found by instrumenting §1.1, DONE (`3a68534`) [M]**

Not in CLAUDE.md's Tier-1/Tier-2 lists, and it should be. Measured on the
late-game workload: **136,860,059 calls, mean scan length 41.86, 5.73 billion
uint64 comparisons.** It ran `std::count` over *every* history slot — but only a
position with the same side to move can repeat, and the Zobrist key carries a
side-to-move term, so half the slots could never match. Stepping by two is
node-identical by construction.

⚠️ The parity is **not** simply "every other slot". `doNullMove` flips the side
without pushing an entry, so inside a null-move subtree the current position
sits on the opposite parity. `Board::nullPly` tracks it. The first attempt put
the increment in `doMove` instead of `doNullMove` and bench6 diverged
immediately (1,922,755 vs 1,953,820) — **the node-identity check earned its
keep.** Do not touch this code without it.

Result: bench6 exactly neutral (0.945s both — opening positions have short
clocks), **+1.58% on the late-game workload** (median 46.120s → 45.390s, new
binary won all 5 interleaved pairs). Kept for being node-identical and never
slower; the honest Elo expectation is well under 1, below SPRT resolution.

**2.4 `nonPawnMajors` is computed unconditionally [C]** — `searcher.cpp:849`, four
bitboard ORs plus a popcount at every node, consumed only by `canNullMove`
(line 890). **[X]** Moving it behind the short-circuit was measured NPS-neutral on
2026-07-28 — but that was several nets and a different tree ago. Low priority,
re-measurable.

---

## 3. Memory and cache — the largest unexamined surface

Measured struct sizes on this build **[M]**:

```
SearchRuntime      1,028,056 B   (0.98 MB PER THREAD)
  contHist           802,816 B   <-- 78% of it
  corrHist           196,608 B
  history             16,384 B
  captureHistory       3,584 B
MovePicker             1,768 B
Board                  6,400 B
Board::MoveState          32 B
chess::Move                3 B
```

**3.1 `contHist` is 785 KiB and every probe is a cache miss [C/H]**

`int16_t contHist[2][7][64][7][64]` = 401,408 cells. That is larger than a typical
per-core L2, so essentially every continuation-history read in move ordering
(`sorter.cpp:91`) and every update (`searcher.cpp:467`, `678`) is an L3-or-DRAM
access, in the hottest ordering path. The design comment justifies it with "a
24-position fixed-depth bench dropped ~6% nodes" — a *node* argument that never
priced the *cache* cost. Both directions are worth measuring:
narrowing the trailing index, or splitting into a smaller hot table.
⚠️ `perf` overstates memory-bound code ~3× here — trust interleaved wall-clock.

**3.2 `softResetHistory` streams ~820 KiB per search per thread [C/M]**

```cpp
// searchruntime.hpp:100-105 — runs at the start of EVERY search, on every thread
for (int i = 0; i < CONT_HIST_CELLS; ++i) contHistFlat[i] >>= 1;   // 401,408 cells
```

At 4+0.04 a search is ~0.1 s, so this is ~1 MB read + 1 MB written before any node
is searched, multiplied by thread count at the same instant. Cheap to test: gate
the halving to run every N searches, or skip `contHist` specifically.

**3.3 `MovePicker` is 1,768 B and qsearch default-constructs then move-assigns [C]**

`searcher.cpp:1043` declares `MovePicker movePicker;` and `1077` move-assigns the
generator's result, so the live prefix is memcpy'd instead of being constructed in
place. Restructuring to direct-initialise both branches removes a copy from
50–80% of all nodes.

---

## 4. NNUE

**4.1 A benchmark comment that says the optimisation is a pessimisation [C]**

```
// accumulator.hpp:143-144
// Il guadagno sta negli accessi in memoria, non nelle somme: [...]
// Misurato in isolamento, 145 ns contro 98 per le due separate.
```

Read literally, this says the fused `updateMove` costs **145 ns against 98 ns for
the two separate calls it replaces** — i.e. the fast path is *slower*. Either the
numbers are transposed or the optimisation is inverted. This is in the single
hottest function in the engine (two 512-wide int16 rows per piece event). **Settle
it with a direct measurement.** If the comment is right as written, deleting
`updateMove` is both a speedup and a branch removal.

**4.2 Italian comments violate the project rule [C]** — `accumulator.hpp:136-149`
and `152-154`. `CLAUDE.md` and the standing instruction require English in code.
Convert when this file is next touched.

**4.3 Architecture is the lever with the best recent evidence [X/H]** — 512→1024
was +3.37; one layer → two (`deep16`) was +7.89. The L2 is only **16 wide**.
L2=32 or a third layer is the natural next step. ⚠️ The *first* deep16 attempt
lost outright (H0, LLR −2.29); only the reordered/sparse variants won — depth
alone is not sufficient, weight layout matters.

---

## 5. Verified sound — no action

Genuinely good code; listed so nobody re-audits it.

- **TT** (`tt.hpp`) — lockless XOR hashing is correct; payload-then-key store order
  is safe in both interleavings; bucket replacement scores age over depth
  sensibly; prefetch is already issued at both `doMove` sites. **[X]** Smaller TT
  was tested twice and is dead (16 MiB = −1.44 ±3.80 over 15,662 games).
- **`doMove`/`undoMove`** (`boardapi.cpp` → `boardapi.inl`) — one runtime switch
  dispatching to `if constexpr` templated specialisations per `MoveKind`. This is
  the right shape already; there is no branch left to remove.
- **SEE** (`sorter.cpp:124`) — the return *order* encodes the value ladder
  P<N<B<R<Q<K. ⚠️ Do not "simplify" the queen test by merging it with
  bishops/rooks: it would return QUEEN where a rook also attacks, and that wrong
  value feeds the swap list. **[X]** The PEXT-gating micro-opt was measured
  neutral and rejected.
- **Lazy SMP** (`searcher.cpp:225-328`) — depth diversification (+6.40) and thread
  voting (+4.29) both won and are correctly implemented.
- **`evalStack`** is `static thread_local` — correct, and load-bearing.

---

## 6. Open debts

**6.1 ProbCut (`73b877d`) is in the shipped build, unvalidated.** Its SPRT stopped
at +5.39 ±12.21, LOS 80.7%, LLR 0.32 — indistinguishable from zero. The +82.3
calibration measured it *together with* the qsearch fix and cannot separate them.
Finish that SPRT. If negative, `git revert 73b877d` — and note that would also
invalidate the reasoning behind re-tuning `PROBCUT_MARGIN`.

**6.2 The latent-stalls bug is still live [M].** The 260 SPRT logged
`base: 1 timeout, 1 crash / new: 2 timeouts, 2 crashes` — **6 in 3472 games ≈
0.17%**, inside the long-recorded 0.1–0.2% band, roughly symmetric so it biases
nothing. But unlike an Elo tweak it costs *whole games* in real play. This is a
debugging problem, not a measurement one, and it is the best-value non-Elo target
left.

---

## 7. Ranked plan

Ordered by (expected Elo × confidence) ÷ cost.

| # | action | evidence | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`REPETITION_DRAW_ADVANTAGE_THRESHOLD`~~ | **DONE `5291b28` — dead branch, 0 Elo. Ranking wrong.** | — |
| ~~2~~ | ~~Rescale aspiration windows~~ | **DEAD — −7.72, and 100% is a local minimum both ways. Premise wrong.** | — |
| 3 | Finish the ProbCut SPRT | **[M]** unvalidated code is shipped | machine time only |
| 4 | Settle the `updateMove` benchmark contradiction | **[C]** hottest function | ~1 h |
| 5 | Hoist the `excludedMove` invariant; fail-soft delta return | **[C]** free, node-identical | ~1 h |
| 6 | Re-tune `search_evalmargins` on the fixed tree | **[C]** those margins were compensating for the bug | SMAC3 run |
| 7 | Saturation control → decide the phase-split question | **[M]** 1.99 vs 3.20 unexplained | ~1 h |
| 8 | `contHist` cache-cost experiment | **[M]** 785 KiB, never priced | ~half day |
| 9 | Hunt the stalls bug | **[M]** 0.17%, whole games | open-ended |
| 10 | NNUE L2 width 16 → 32 | **[X]** best-evidenced architecture lever | training run |

**Scoreboard on this document's own predictions (2026-09-03).** My top two
ranked items were both wrong: #1 was a dead branch (0 Elo), #2 measured −7.72
and its premise turned out to be backwards. What *did* pay was
`countRepetitions` (§2.5) — which was not on the list at all and surfaced only
from instrumenting #1. **Treat the ranking below as hypotheses to be measured,
not a queue to be worked.** Cost so far of following the discipline instead of
the list: ~2 hours, versus the ~8 an unmeasured march down the ranking would
have spent to reach the same place.

**Method note.** Today's result did not come from a list like this one. It came
from analysing 2400 games that had *already been played*. Of the candidates I
reasoned out from first principles, the data-gap hypothesis was falsified and the
corrhist-cap idea was a provable no-op (`CORR_TOTAL_CAP` never binds: 0 hits in
~1.7M calls **[M]**) — while the finding that mattered came from interrogating a
PGN. **Mine the games before trusting the list.**

---

## 8. Graveyard — do not retry

From SPRT logs and the project record. Re-testing these costs hours and returns
nothing.

| change | result |
|---|---|
| RFP depth gate widened | **37.03%, LOS 0.00%** — lost hard |
| Node-effort time management | H0 accepted, −4.0 ±5.2 @8682 |
| IIR `depth>=6`→`>=4` | +1.37 ±3.37 @20,000 — null (was LOS 92% at 17k!) |
| LMR `moveIndex>=4`→`>=3` | −1.80 ±6.89 |
| LMR `depth>=2` + guard | −6.84 ±11.89 |
| Check-extension cap removed | −10.28 ±14.33 |
| History divisor 8192→4096 | +1.48 ±4.85 — flat, +19.7% nodes |
| TT 16 MiB / 8 MiB | −1.44 ±3.80 / −1.97 ±9.62 |
| PGO | −4% / −9%, twice |
| Razoring (re-added) | +1.1 ±6.4 — still redundant |
| Multi-ply contHist in ordering | −7 Elo |
| NNUE training budget past 320 SB | +29.4 → +9.9 → +2.7, exhausted |
| More same-distribution data | −7.30 ±8.61 |
| SEE PEXT-gating micro-opt | node-identical, NPS-neutral |
| `fullMoveClock` uint8 saturation | **provably 0 Elo** — see §9 |
| `MAX_QSEARCH_DEPTH` vs absolute ply | **0 firings in 36.5M qsearch calls** — see §9 |
| contHist dead row removed (7→6) | node-identical, NPS-neutral — see §9 |

## 9. The "obvious waste" sweep — three items, zero Elo

All three read like defects. None of them is worth an SPRT. Recorded so they are
not re-litigated.

**`fullMoveClock` is `uint8_t` and saturates at 255 — 0 Elo, no measurement
needed.** Its only consumer is `movesPlayed` in `Engine::searchUCI`, which feeds
exactly two things: `estimateMovesToGo() = max(20, 50 - movesPlayed)`, constant
from move 30 on, and the opening ramp, live only below move 6 and only without an
increment. The value is *ignored* from move 30 onward, so a clamp at 255 cannot
change a decision. Widening the type is cosmetic.

**`MAX_QSEARCH_DEPTH = 48` is compared against absolute `ply`, not qsearch depth
— real, and completely dead.** Instrumented over a 10-position sweep:

| depth | qsearch calls | `ply >= 48` | max ply reached |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | 4,098,853 | **0** | 36 |
| 18 | 36,513,640 | **0** | 40 |

Max ply grows ~1 per depth, so the gate would first bite somewhere past depth 25 —
beyond anything reached at any TC we play. The real recursion backstop is
`ply >= MAX_PLY - 1` (`searcher.cpp:143`). Same class as the repetition-contempt
branch: a genuine unit confusion guarding a case that never occurs.

**contHist row 0 was unreachable on both ends — removed, and it bought nothing.**
`int16_t contHist[2][7][64][7][64]` indexed by piece type at both ends, where both
ends are a piece that just moved and so can never be EMPTY. That left
`1 - (6/7)^2 = 26.5%` of the table allocated, decayed by `softResetHistory`, never
read. Verified before touching it: **386,349,984 block lookups and 12,723,846
context builds at depth 18, zero with piece type 0 at either end.** Shrunk to
`[2][6][64][6][64]`, biasing indices down by one: **784 KiB → 576 KiB per thread**,
bench6 byte-identical at 1,953,820.

The speed it bought, measured interleaved on identical trees:

| config | result |
|---|---|
| 1 thread, depth 13, 15 reps | median −0.52%, min +0.29% — **signs disagree** |
| 8 threads, 2.5 s fixed, 15 reps | paired ratio 95% CI **[0.887, 1.064]**, 8/15 wins |

**Nothing.** The dead rows were never *touched*, so they never occupied a cache
line — they cost address space, not bandwidth. Kept for hygiene and the smaller
footprint, not for Elo.

⚠️ The 8-thread rig cannot resolve better than ±9%: Lazy SMP varied tree size 2×
at fixed depth (1.7M–4.2M nodes), and sustained 8-thread load throttles this
machine (nodes drifted 8.2M → 3.9M across one run). Use 1-thread node-identical
timing for micro-optimisations; do not trust an 8-thread median.

**The pattern across all three:** "obviously wasteful" and "obviously wrong" are
statements about the code, not about the search. Each was true as written and
worth nothing as an Elo play. Measure the firing rate first — it cost ~40 minutes
here and saved three SPRTs.

**Two measurement laws earned the hard way.** (1) The fixed-depth node profile
does **not** predict the sign — the LMR gate won +13.36 *with* tactical +26%.
(2) LLR is a random walk with drift: today it went 2.09 → 1.91 → 2.30 → 2.98 and
crossed. Neither a dip nor a plateau is diagnostic; compare LLR at equal N before
citing a precedent.

## 10. searcher.cpp sweep (2026-09-06)

Profile first: `searchPosition` 11.7% self, `quiescenceSearch` 1.7%, movegen 5.4%
total, `sortLegalMoves` 3.3%.

**Shipped (8647ad7), +0.79% pooled over 57 paired reps, node-identical.** Two
sites computed expensive things before the tests that gate their only consumer:

| site | calls before | after | cut |

Both are pure reorderings of short-circuit terms. Runs: +1.19% (CI [+0.29%,
+2.10%], 12/15), +0.68% ([-0.49%, +1.86%], 9/17), +0.62% ([-0.34%, +1.58%],
14/25).

**Measured and rejected:**

| idea | result |
|---|---|
| Drop per-move `shouldAbort()` (redundant with the child's `enterNode` + the `isInterrupted()` break) | **-0.78%**, CI [-1.90%, +0.34%]. The atomic is an L1-resident load with a perfectly predicted branch. |
| Prefetch the three corrHist cells early | **0.00%** median, CI [-1.23%, +0.97%]. Out-of-order execution already covered them. |
| movegen: drop redundant `isValidSquare(ep)`, pass `ownOcc` into `computePinRays`, gate castling on rights | CI [-1.32%, +0.80%] and [-1.67%, +0.83%]. Predicted prize ~0.05-0.1%, an order of magnitude under the harness floor. |
| SEE magic lookups behind pseudo-attack tables | **-2.66%**, CI [-3.44%, -1.89%], faster in 1/15 |

**Four per-node branches that fired zero times. NONE should be deleted, and two
of them are not dead at all** (an earlier revision of this section mislabelled
them; the zero counts are real, the "dead" reading was not):

| branch | firings | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| king-capture terminal in `enterNode` | 0 / 13,045,297 | genuinely redundant, but deleting it **measured -0.73%** |
| `ply >= MAX_PLY - 1` | 0 / 13,045,297 | **live guard.** Protects `evalStack[MAX_PLY]` and `killerMoves[MAX_PLY][2]`. The probe reached max ply 40 against a limit of 64; infinite mode sets targetDepth = MAX_PLY, so it is reachable |
| `maxNodes` cap | 0 / 13,045,297 | **not dead, it is the UCI `go nodes` feature.** Zero because the probe used `go depth` |
| mate-narrowing `alpha >= beta` | 1 / 5,540,173 | one compare; the narrowing above it does the work |

The king guard is redundant rather than merely cold: every entry into the
recursion goes through `runIterativeDeepening` (`searchBestMove`, `ponderLoop`,
`datagen` are the only three), which guards missing kings at the root, and a king
cannot vanish mid-search because movegen is fully legal and the hash move is
validated against the generated list. Removing it anyway measured **-0.73%**
(95% CI [-1.65%, +0.19%], faster in 4/17 pairs), so it stays. It also prevents an
out-of-bounds `KING_ATTACKS[64]` read if that invariant is ever broken.

📌 Generalisation: **a zero firing count does not imply removable.** Check whether
the branch is (a) a guard for an invariant, (b) an inactive feature, or (c) truly
unreachable, before calling it dead. And even for (c), deleting a
perfectly-predicted branch from a hot path is as likely to cost as to gain.

**The one structural opportunity left: staged move generation.** 53.4% of nodes
consume exactly one move while generating and scoring ~33. What that one move is:
good capture 53.5%, killer 29.6%, hash 13.8%, countermove 1.1%, quiet 1.8%. So
**98.1% of single-move cutoffs need no quiet generation at all**, and staging
would skip quiet generation plus quiet scoring at ~52% of nodes. Against the 8.7%
that generation and scoring cost, that is worth roughly **3% of runtime**.

⚠️ The cheap version does NOT work: "try the TT move before generating" covers
only the 13.8% hash slice, 7.4% of nodes, ~0.6% of runtime. The value is in the
capture and killer stages.

⚠️ It changes node counts, so it needs an SPRT, not a bench. And it cannot assume
captures outrank quiets: a quiet scores `clamp(history) + clamp(contHist)/2`,
reaching 11250 against `CAPTURE_BASE_SCORE` 10000. Measured at 0.097% of cutoff
nodes today, so harmless, but the bands are not separated by construction.
