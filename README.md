## chess_engine ##



# Description

  This is software entirely made in C++ to play chess using 
  the terminal, it's tested on W11 and Ubuntu 20.04 so far.
  As soon as I complete implementing every rule I'll start 
  programming an engine to play against.


# Compile

  W11: 
    g++ *.cpp
    a.exe
    
    try running "chcp 65001" if chessboard doesn't display
    properly. Doesn't work on Powershell but works on CMD.
      
  UBUNTU 20.04:
    g++ *.cpp
    ./a.out

  using g++ and "-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic" to get more 
  informations abuot warnings & notes.
