## chess_engine ##



# Description

  This is a script entirely made in C++ which lets you play chess
  using the terminal, it's tested on W11 and Ubuntu 20.04 so far.
  
  TODO:
    As soon as I complete implementing every rule I'll start 
    programming an engine to play against.


# Compile

  W11: 
    g++ *.cpp
    a.exe
    
    try running "chcp 65001" if chessboard doesn't display
    properly. Doesn't work on Powershell but works on CMD.
      
  UBUNTU 20.04:
    g++ *.cpp
    ./a.out
