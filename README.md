## chess_engine ##



# Description

This is a script made in C++ which lets you play chess using the terminal (no graphics libraries).
It's been tested on W11, W10 and Ubuntu 20.04 so far.

TODO:
As soon as I complete implementing every rule I'll start programming an engine to play against.


# Compile

"g++ -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror *.cpp"
Then run "a.exe" for Windows or "./a.out" for Linux.
Windows only: try running "chcp 65001" if chessboard doesn't display properly. If it doesn't work on Powershell then
try it on the CMD.

MORE INFOS:
Run with -DDEBUG to get the execution time of each move (excluding how much it takes for the user to input the move.
Run with -O3 to get aggressive optimizations, from my tests it looks like it doesn't break the program, and it also
looks like the very first move is gonna take relatively more time but this issue goes away right after.

# How does it work?

After running the program it's gonna ask you which color you want to play with, which should make no sense, I left it
because it's gonna be useful after I complete the first version of the engine.
After inputting "W" to play as white, to input every move you will have to select the coordinates of the square of the
piece you want to move and then select the coordinates of the destination square; for example let's say white's first
move is pawn to e4, we have to input this: "e2 e4" (which can be seen as: "move the piece in e2 to e4), you can also
input moves in this way (same example as before): "e 2 e 4" or "e2e4"; you can also input "Q" to quit or "M" to print
more infos.
