#
# ordo's -m (multi-anchor) hard-fails if ANY named anchor has zero finished
# games in the PGN yet - which is normal for the first minute or two of a
# run, before every SF-<elo> level has completed at least one game. This
# filters the anchors file down to whichever anchors already appear in the
# PGN, so early polls degrade gracefully instead of erroring out.
#
# Also works around an ordo 1.2.6 bug: -m only reliably PINS an anchor when
# there are 2+ anchors in the file. With exactly one (e.g. a solo run vs one
# SF level, or early in a bracket run before a 2nd level has finished a
# game), it silently applies a partial/wrong shift instead of an exact pin
# (verified: a lone SF-3000 anchor came out at 2681, not 3000). The classic
# single-anchor -a/-A pair pins correctly in that case, so this script
# switches to it whenever exactly one anchor currently has data.
#
# Usage: watch -n 15 ./watch_calibration.sh
# (auto-finds the most recently started sfcal_*.pgn/anchors pair in this dir)
